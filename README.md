Absolutely thrilled to share my latest project, Fokir! ðŸš€ 

For this assignment, I recreated a responsive website with a clean, modern design and animation features to enhance user experience. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ Exact Replica: The design is a pixel-perfect match with the original, capturing the aesthetic and structure across all sections.
ðŸ”¹ Animation Effects: Added optional animation for the first section to give it that extra spark! 
ðŸ”¹ Portfolio & Feedback Sections: The portfolio is displayed as a static layout for a seamless browsing experience, and feedback is showcased through a single stylish card.
ðŸ”¹ Design Details: Used a semi-transparent overlay, icons from Font Awesome, and a resizable textarea for a polished and user-friendly design.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used:
- HTML5 & CSS3: for clean, structured, and responsive layouts
- JavaScriptâ€‹: to manage animations and interactivity
-Font Awesome: to integrate sleek icons and enhance UI.
